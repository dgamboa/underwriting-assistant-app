# Divvy UW Assistant

## Overview
This is an UW assistant designed to help Divvy's underwriting backup team when they have simple questions about the underwriting process.

## How It Works
The assistant is powered by a large language model that is trained on a variety of documents related to Divvy's underwriting process. When a user asks a question, the assistant uses a combination of RAG and LLM to generate a response.
